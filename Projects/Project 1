## 📌 Projects Overview
### 🔹 Project 1: [CubeSat Ground-Station Telemetry Console]
**Patriot-1**, a 3U CubeSat, is now in low-Earth orbit and periodically down-links a 32-byte telemetry packet containing sensor readings such as temperature, battery, and orientation.  

This project implements a **Ground-Station Telemetry Console** that:  
- Parses telemetry packets and displays the satellite status.  
- Accepts operator commands (fire thrusters, toggle SAFE-MODE, run autonomous ticks).  
- Keeps the spacecraft alive despite temperature swings, battery drain, and radiation-induced glitches.  

The project practices structured control flow, deterministic pseudo-random testing, interactive I/O, and modular program design.

## Features
- **Telemetry Parsing:** Reads and displays temperature, battery, and orientation error.  
- **Operator Commands:**  
  - `[L] Live-tick` – processes exactly 1 packet.  
  - `[R] Run N ticks` – simulates N packets and displays the final state.  
  - `[T] Fire thruster` – reduces orientation error (costs battery).  
  - `[S] Toggle SAFE-MODE` – restricts commands & clamps drift.  
  - `[Q] Quit mission` – prints a final health report and ends the program.  
- **Simulation Logic:**  
  - Handles temperature changes, battery drain, orientation drift, and radiation hits.  
  - SAFE-MODE clamps extreme changes and ignores unsafe commands.  
  - Automatic mission abort on critical satellite failure (temp < -20°C or > 90°C, battery = 0%, |orient_err| > 45° for 3 consecutive ticks).
